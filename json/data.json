      "description": "<p>Look, an image, without me. Now we’re without each other again. Hooyo, who cried when I went to Paris because I had never spent more than a night away from her. You haven’t told me much about the neighbourhood, the people there, their stories. that playground. Your own loneliness waiting for my father, your husband. The long nights. Leaving your entire family behind and coming somewhere new. The picture doesn’t show the bus that came for you each morning, hauling you and the neighbourhood woman to Danish classes. By the end, you were promised perfect Danish and no one inspecting you in the supermarket. Away from everyone and everything you knew. They had lied. No matter how perfect your Danish got, the stares continued. I know now there was so much I could have asked and never did. Where did you want to run when it got bad? Was it back on a plane or was it back to this park you’re sitting in? On that bench with your pink baati and gabasaar, abo with the double denim. What did you lose? I’m talking to the picture because I’m out of your house, and I’m using it as a filler until I get back to you. You gave me many things, but to get me ready for marriage and a house, you gave me biscuits, sweets, cake, and dried meat. Instructions for what to do when guests come over. A warning against dirt and mess, against not wearing a bra, against letting myself go. But nothing about what to do when I don’t want to get out of bed, or when he gets sick of me being down, again. </p> <br> <p>A mother’s manual for survival. What would it say exactly? <em>I’m giving you space from me, so call me when you want but I won’t be calling you. Imagine throwing a fit with no audience, smashing the plates with nobody coming home to notice, making a mess of your body and nobody being close enough to touch it, rub it to make it warm again? Become a rock. Rocks don’t get hurt. You throw it out and it doesn’t bruise, you take it away from everything it knows, and it keeps the same face, step on it and it hurts you back. Become hard to anything and everything that doesn’t want you alive. I don’t recognize you like this, body flat against the floor in the centre of a dark room. You were so glad when the mirror smashed. Struggle stops. There are no soldiers in the street yet here you are, a bloody fight in one body. Who hurt you? It’s only us here. You’re nothing like me. I thought I left you behind.</em></p><br><p>Hooyo, I can’t explain the sadness. You wouldn’t understand it I don’t think. But then again, I don’t know because you haven’t told me. Maybe I haven’t asked the right questions. When we get back to each other, can we ask new ones? Ones that recognize I’m no longer a child, that walking out of your house doesn’t mean I’m dead to you. A flat and a life away from you. It’s a different kind of blue. This is how you to taught me to love. Must be listening ear and quiet mouth. Must be opened door holding a cake fresh out of the oven, burning at the ends if need be. Must be quick to help first always, otherwise love will end. Must always remember people come back for me when I’m not sad. Must be begging for mercy, surprised if it ever comes. When she&#39;s thinking about us kids dying before her, hooyo repeats &#39;you don&#39;t belong to me, you belong to God&#39; or &#39;you&#39;re not mine’ and it helps in some way. If she says it enough times to herself, she’ll start to believe it. That’s the hope. Meaning she&#39;s doing what I’m doing, which is going to places alone, eating alone, sitting alone, and getting used to it because there&#39;ll be a time when there&#39;s no one left. There was a time I swore going anywhere alone would have killed me. The first time I walked alone to school I cried all the way. It’s funny, I don&#39;t remember the feeling and only have an image of me taking steps and sniffling all the way to the gate. The image as an extension of you. Knowing I don’t need the image at all, but I would take it everywhere. That’s what she said, the girl I was photographing. She said she kept her parents’ picture close to her at all times and I should have asked, what does it give you that their physicality doesn’t? Can you ask the picture things you can’t ask them? Is the photograph more forgiving? This would be the image I’d tape to my bedroom door. When I could have gone across the hall and posed the question directly to my parents, I didn’t. I sat there and stared at its creases and wrote down the questions and thought, I’ll write a poem and the poem will give me answers.</p><br> <p><strong>Somali words</strong></p><br> <p><em>Hooyo – mother <br> Abo – father <br>  Baati – Somali house dress <br>  Gabasaar – Scarf worn with dresses</em></p>"

So, I walked down Mason’s Yard and I met you there.</p><br><p>The first thing I noticed was the smell of red wine and it made me feel quite nostalgic. </p><br><p>I think my strongest memory of the smell of red wine was probably about 9 years previous to that. My parents were divorcing, I was about 14 and I came home one day from school, so it was probably about half past 3 or 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon and as soon as I opened the door I could smell red wine. I went to the back of the house to the back room where the smell was coming from and there was a big stain, a red wine stain down one of the curtains in the backroom and there was smashed glass on the floor. Obviously, you know, we washed the curtains, we cleaned them. Sanitised the area.</p><br><p>[Background sound 2: Recording of birds in the evening in Poland layered over background sound 1]</p><br><p>The second thing I noticed was this metallic dripping sound and you smelt like iron.

You know, I was in a cold old barn, and you were just standing skeletal in front of me, just really kind of pared back, very bare, very stark. But that smell of red wine just really embraced me as soon as I walked into the room. </p><br><p>You led me through a plywood passageway, it was quite long and it was, the walls on either side were quite tall so I couldn’t see over them. I walked through the passageway and when I came through you were on the floor, just the salt of your skin laid bare like your physical body had evaporated. I walked over, and I was in a very bright white room at this point and I joined the crowd around you and I bowed my head down, and I realised that we were all bowing our heads in grief. And it was very quiet apart from the sound of birds. You were very silent and the smell of salt from your body seemed to purify the room around us.</p><br><p>I realised at the time that this was a story much bigger than you and I really sensed loss that was bigger than you. </p><br><p>I walked out of the white room and I left you behind and walked through onto the grey tiled streets around Mason’s Yard and I went through the passageway and back into the road.</p><br><p>It’s quite a wealthy part of town around there, you know, there’s bookshops and galleries and auctioneers but everywhere was kind of empty that day. And it was an odd juxtaposition, you were kind of so powerful but hidden from view. You just sort of existed there quite quiet and isolated. Like a memory you’d been documented but you were, you know, you seemed displaced. </p><br><p>[Background sounds 1 and 2 fade out]</p>"

      "description": "<p>This is a photograph of me as a baby and of my mum spending time with our friend Delene in her little wooden cottage in West End, Brisbane, Australia.  The three reclining female figures here mirror each other in a relaxed bohemian composition. This image captures something allusive. It is self-consciously locating its history, as well as the agency of women. At the time when the photograph was being taken my mother was deciding where to live, Australia or England. </p><br><p>The first thing I was drawn to in this photo was my mum’s posture. She is lying on a chaise lounge with one hand behind her head. I noticed that her posture is echoing that of the figure in the painting above: The framed print of Goya’s <em>The Clothed Maja (La Maja Vestida)</em>’. Knowing my mum and Del, two intelligent women who are very interested in art, history, and literature, I suspected the connection between my mum’s pose and the subject in the painting was not a coincidence. For me, this image speaks of the power (and complexity) of decision-making in creating agency for women. When I asked them later about this photograph, they said yes, the painting resonated with them, particularly relating to the exclusive interior world women inhabit, and which is the source of their creativity and strength.  </p><br><p>This is my first visit (the first of many) to this home, where mum was showing Del her new baby for the first time. This marks a time in our life together, where mum was making big decisions as a single parent particularly where to live and what opportunities there were for me. I imagine that on this day Del and mum were talking and dreaming as friends do. Here, they took a moment of genius to create a photograph that included their internal world, the world contained by the painting, and the expectation that one day this image would be read and understood. If not by anyone else, likely by the young baby in the picture. </p><br><p>Goya’s <em>The Clothed Maja (La Maja Vestida)</em> (created between 1800 and 1805) is of the Romanticism period of painting and the composition has been referenced in many later paintings that were influenced by this complex depiction of women where the identity cannot be fixed and where there is a female reclining figure challenging social norms. Most notably Manet’s painting Olympia’ challenges the traditional portraiture of women. The point of view in painting most often comes from men, and the women were objects. Goya’s painting of, ‘The Clothed Maya’ has the woman looking directly at the artist and to the world. This oppositional gaze holds the viewer, claims the space, and demands agency and independence. She is centered in herself. This relaxed confidence in the feminine permeates the room. </p><br><p><em>The Clothed Maja</em> contests many closely held beliefs about women. Maja was a term used for gypsies. The woman is relaxing but is yet a worker. She is confidant in her sexuality, but this confidence has led to outrage from feminist activists in Washington. There is an alternative version painted by Goya with the woman being naked. The two paintings were confiscated during the Spanish Inquisition as the female figure was considered both defiant and dangerous. Both paintings of this mysterious woman hang in the Prado Museum in Madrid. </p><br><p>So many narratives surround this painting. The stories of the women who are friends sitting in a bedroom in Brisbane are not submissive. Independence and fearlessness are very important to their worlds.  I find there is an intentionality to this photograph, not just a casually snapped photo of friends but a composition put together to reflect on the moment.  Purposefully, my mum is continuing the tradition of this style of portraiture by looking straight at the camera. My mum and the photographer are both working women with children. This room is the centre of a woman’s world, a creative space. The objects in the room are curated. Virginia Woolf claimed that a woman needs a room of her own to create, to craft her own life.  The luxury of time to contemplate and confidence to be themselves.</p><br><p>Symbols of womanhood continue as we look further into the room from the perspective of the mirror panels on the closet doors. Those closets hide a rich other world of fashion, every colour and of many fashion eras. Through the mirrors we can see the colour theming of the room, for me now the soft colours generate a feeling of womb-like protection. Even practical items are decorative, like the doily covered tissue box on the small arabesque table. The feminine is in full force through the soft colours and textures in the home, mum’s pose overtly showing her body, and me as a small baby using high-heeled shoes as a teething tool. However, it would be a mistake to assume that ‘representation of the feminine’ is where the image ends. With the woman in the painting, and, with those in and behind the photograph, finding confidence and sense of self. This is a private sacred space, with curtains in view in the mirror, with the mirror itself containing what looks like to be added wallpaper panels for privacy. </p><br><p>This scene is performative in nature as it has been thoughtfully constructed, with attention brought to the positioning of the subjects and objects located to tell other stories outside the frame.  This is a boudoir in West End. Margaret Olley lived just around the corner. Margaret Olley painted many of her interiors in this sort of house in this neighborhood. Although the woman in Goya’s painting is considering her world of 18th century Spain, there is a sense that we are close to her, so far away in a wooden cottage in Brisbane.  The shells hanging from the chandelier remind me of pilgrimage, of the oceans we cross to find home. </p><br><p>The composure of the group is enlivened by the presence of the baby.  The coiled energy adds an element of surprise. The photographer has no control of how the child will act – the baby is unselfconscious, in the moment, full of life, full of possibilities. While mum’s posture intentionally reflects the figure in the portrait, Del has positioned a crawling baby doll to the right of me (only the pink satin legs are in view, which I first mistook for a négligée) so that my positioning is also reflective of the posture of a baby. As a baby girl, I complete the triangular formation of women from different times and ages. Each of us signal the feminine without referencing any other power. The subjects use posture, gaze, and a relaxed sense of self that speaks of resolution.</p>"

      "description": "<p>You haven’t wished me happy birthday yet. It’s ok. I’m not angry with you, no one has, not even the child. This I have determined, that no one really has the foggiest, the slightest, the merest hint of a clue that it is today. Birthdays isn’t something I bothered with at first, or any of this measuring, counting. The days were much like the nights at first, it is that way when you do not sleep. But the more I watched, the more I learned, the more I became aware of the waiting. And so I began to count, to divide, subdivide. There is, after all, an awful lot of waiting. Then, some days, event days, those days pierce the great big moth addled drudge of it all. Those days, fold the fabric of the world of the likes of you and the likes of me together so close, and pinch. Pressing through. Invigorating. I am jumping ahead. I’ll get back to the birthday.</p><br><p>Do you remember being born? Probably you do not, for it is not in your nature. Sin mar atá sé. I do, or at least, I remember the first sight. Perhaps you do have one of those. It was the view from the backseat. Much like where we are now. Perhaps you recognise it. It, the first sight, came through the back window. It was a mouth, the mouth. At the time I did not have your words, this was all sensation, I’m translating now with what pieces I have assembled. This was on a grey day. The inside of the car was grey, the outside of the car was grey, the sky was grey, the road was grey. The rain chased itself sideways tracing greylines across the window. But then came the mouth. The moment of its arrival. It lashed against the glass, as things always lash against windows, a gap surrounded by a smearing mop of brown and black fur against the grey sky. It, the mouth, was a not as in n.o.t as in negation, as in that rare kind of tear in this material of things, a swallowing of sense and light. Then it, the mouth, was sudden pink tongue lolling then it, the mouth, was sudden teeth dirty white flicking, then rage furious oh the sound, sudden rising, bark bark bark, frustrated punctuation, frantic rolling cadences. Bark bark bark. Béal an mhadaidh, a total all, this the first sight. </p><br><p>Then I saw the watching. The second sight. The child watching. I was repulsed at their rapt attention. Transfixed. Wide eyed at the mouth of the dog on the glass. How dare they consume my sight. I watched their watching. This arrived with a dull blow: this was why I was here. To watch and to wait, tethered to this dribbling crying foolish consciousness. This certainty arrived immediate, not in words but in a rush of disgust and relief at my purpose. I felt the fear flowing, and did I feel alive.</p><br><p>I was still a shadow then.  Scáth na scáthanna. I had no real shape or form. Those came later. It took months before I could hold anything for longer than an instant. This came through watching, through great concentration, by watching every aspect of a form. Every detail. Probably you have not done this, you may fancy you have but I mean every detail. I think it is impossible for beings like you, for you are not really watchers. Mostly you are, I am sad to say ignorers. Your attention comes by blocking out most of what comes to your senses.</p><br><p>I am being harsh. You may forgive me. It is hard to be so frustrated and yet so dependent matter such as this. This is what it feels like, watching from the back seat, never being the one driving, never being the one who charts the course. And, of course, the child. They are still the child though it has been 40 years since the mouth, I can still see the child, I cannot help but see the child, in their clumsy form. When their childishness is most clear, when they are closest to the purity of transfixed watching I am most alive. </p><br><p>Think of it like your hunger. Without this gift things are perhaps cold, certainly pale, somehow there is always enough basic fuel to sustain counting, to sustain waiting. But enthusiasm, joy? Such richness comes only on special days. Sometimes jolts come sudden. I am waiting in the shadow and the child sees a presence in the corner of the eye. These odd boons, dizzying rushes like the sharp awakening from a night terror bring me to fullness again, fluid, flowing, strong. The child cowers when I am full like that. Though they do not acknowledge me. That, they refuse me.</p><br><p>I tried once to have the child acknowledge me. To offer. To reach across the gap. It was a year after my birthday, or thereabouts. I had only the basic words then, anois, anseo, tá mé, bíonn, rudaí mar sin, you know, so I had not the understanding I have now in your words, but I had something else. I knew the forms around me, and I knew how to watch. I had been practicing smiling. I was not quite sure what it should feel like, but my practicing had yielded results. I knew the form of the child, yes, so I practiced smiling as the child. Imagine thinking of every inch of your form at once. That is how this is done, it must be traced over, held ‘in mind’.</p><br><p>So I waited. It was morning. I sensed the morning light would be best. I appeared as the child, as it might be dressed in a dark blue bathrobe, and I waited, I waited on the morning routine to begin, for the child was to be the first down. It was a Saturday and the child was always the first down on Saturday. And I waited. And I held. I held the smile so well. The child, flung itself down the stairs with energy I know the shape of but do not feel, call it bounding. It saw me, stopped. I held its gaze. Smile bathrobe smile bathrobe. I thought, tracing all details in their completeness. The child looked dumb, witless, held-back, and, I felt that rush to fullness, I felt so whole, then, it turned, looked ran away—bounding—the way back up the stairs. I was exhausted. Abandoned. Refused. Shamed. After this it was days, months, inexcusably long before I could hold form, before I could entertain every detail.</p><br><p>Those days when sensation comes sharp were denied to me. D’fhoghlaim mé focail nua, cruthanna nua, new forms I did observe but I was again a shadow. And so I waited. I stole what gifts when I could, fellow shadows of shadows and noises unexplained, spike sharpenings of attention, but nothing filled me until the calendar days began arriving, collecting. I mean like the stranger at the door, the day of the last Sunday dinner with the family, the day of the great telling off, the day of the kicking. </p><br><p>Those I know the child still recalls, because the rush comes sudden, full and sharp still when the days come ‘around’ again. It took me some time to get to grips with this idea of the days repeating, after all they are different days, but that is one of the reflections of your nature that I must know without full knowing as I am held to it. Some days, I can even form a smile again, and I know that the child knows, somewhere under the rubble of refusals, go-aways, that I am here, waiting.</p><br><p> Mostly I wait for the disaster. Bím ag fanacht leis an tubaiste. Ollmhór. The great disaster. Since I was born to form, pulled from the nothing of the mouth and into your world of feeling and sense that,  this is what I wait on. What end might come that can match my birth, a last sight for the first sight.</p><br><p>Perhaps you also have one of me, who watches your watching, who waits, starved for the fuel of being you would deny it. It is a cruel existence that you would treat it so. That you would deny it even the thought of the disasters, leaving it cooking cold with the anger of the emptiness that seizes us watchers, those of us who wait. Though perhaps you are kinder than the child who tries to feel anything else.</p><br><p>Today I am waiting. I am waiting in the backseat of the car. It is not the same car, but it is the same car, just as the child is not the same child, is a foolish slobbering adult, but is the same child. I am waiting for a sudden swerve, I am waiting for a knock at the window, I am waiting for tears in hallways, I am waiting for a sudden ripping, a resting out of matter for when I can feel the full richness of my form again. It will be my role to take us both back, and in that moment I will be acknowledged, and  in that moment the child will take finally the fullness of my smile and know I have waited and know my due. I am waiting, I am watching from the backseat, for today is my birthday and days come around.</p>"

I suppose their grazing helps keep this land fairly sparse, like great, smooth warm-blooded lawn mowers. To the right, its mostly open, open, but up the slight incline to the left is a small, isolated group of oaks, outriders for the forest behind, some of which are very large, and very old indeed.</p><br><p>After the breakup when I moved back from Canada, I had the strongest desire to see some oak trees. Where I had been living, on the West coast, the trees grew very straight and very tall, slender giants, up and up like arrows shooting into the skies. </p><br><p>Oaks don’t grow particularly straight. They seem to grow outwards as much as upwards, taking their time. Lumbering. gnarled and stooping, great bows bending down into earth like a wise and kindly elder leaning over a cane. </p><br><p>The three or four giants in this group must be a few hundred years old. So large and arching that the very ground changes beneath them. The air changes. Stepping over an invisible threshold, the space feels cavernous overhead, like stepping into a bubble of bark, carpeted by leaf and acorn crunch.</p><br><p>A friend told me that the older trees protect the young saplings and divert some of their own nutrients to the baby roots, sheltering them, nurturing, and encouraging them. The trees sense each-other and feel each-other. Even grieve one another. Their lined, thick trunks make me think of the feet of elephant, pressed firmly into the ground. Elephants are known to walk hundreds of miles to their predetermined grave sites. I wonder if an ancient tree knows how to fall? How does a tree grieve? Supposedly there’s a shark in Greenland that’s over 500-Year-old. I wonder if it’s called Sharkspeare?</p><br><p>One leviathan has fallen, in an earth-shuddering heap. It feels sad, something so large, what I imagine it might be like to approach a beached whale, to be dwarfed by another body, stuck. But from this sideways tree new growth emerges, perpendicular shoots upwards. Toadstools and wedges of yellow fungus, like slabs of cheese grow in the shade of the trunk. Dead and broken branches are a feast of termites, and as they break down, food for worms. New life emerging from death. As I bend down to look closer at a trail of ants stretched along one of the branches, I think about something I’d read about ‘whale-fall’, in which, when a whale dies in the ocean, its carcass will initially float on the surface, providing sustenance to hungry scavengers. And as its mass decreases, eventually the body will sink to the bottom, where the leviathan cadaver can become home to entirely new ecosystems. New life emerging from death.</p><br><p>After the breakup when I moved back from Canada, I had the strongest desire to see some oak trees. Something affirming. A solid point of reference after upheaval. Five years later I still visit them. Back then I took my old boy Zen, now I take Indigo. I don’t think the yearning was from a place of nostalgic homeliness - I grew up in London - in many ways the English countryside still feels alien to me. I guess I just like trees.</p><br><p><strong>Dad’s earliest memories</strong></p><br><p><em>Transcript not available. <br>Audio Credit: Liz Wright </em></p><br><p><strong>The Green Parakeet</strong></p><br><p>I’m going to finish with a story, as it happens a true story.</p><br><p>In the not-too-distant past: A Saturday morning, not quite early but not yet late. A boy in bed, sleeping-in<br>The boy is shaken awake by a mother. He rubs his eyes and looks at her with curiosity. Her eyes are a picture of concern, brow furrowed, her tone urgent. </p><br><p>‘I think there’s something in the chimney - I could hear scratching now and then throughout the night.’<br>The house is one of those Victorian red brick London terraces, in which each room, however small, has its own fireplace. Made obsolete by the invention of domestic central heating systems, these fireplaces are sometimes covered up, or filled in. In this particular establishment they had been left, perhaps for decorative purposes. In fact, the design of the interior of the house had that sort of under-stated, minimal beauty, in which the characteristics and furnishings of the building, vestiges of its period past, were respectfully left alone or simply painted off-white in keeping with the rest of the house.</p><br><p>The building being old, things were known to on occasion fall off. Over time, brick crumbles. Each day the walls shudder as the local bus passes over the speed bump outside. Whilst it was entirely possible, most likely even, that the noises from the chimney were caused by pieces of falling mortar within the chute, the mother’s concern triggered a memory of the story the father had told them years before, about the raven that fell down the chimney. The father had been startled by loud cawing coming from the spare room and was even more surprised to find a confused and distressed raven lying in a soot-covered mess. He had managed to open the window and guide the bird out, the black dust flying as it beat its outstretched wings.</p><br><p>The chimney in question, in the mother’s room, had been blocked years earlier by the father in order to stop any drafts. If anything, living was in there, then its escape would be blocked by the rudimentary plug, carefully constructed from repurposed cardboard packaging boxes. The boy was fearful to dislodge the construction, He thought of the hands that made it…the container of old jumpers in the attic, the box of old scribbled on post-it notes that he kept in his room. Treasured footprints.<br>A flash of green and yellow suddenly appeared outside the window. The boy and the mother looked on in amazement at the green parakeet flapping there, suspended for a moment before disappearing again. The mother remarked that not once in 20 years had a green parakeet been seen outside the window.</p><br><p>They looked at each other in understanding and concern and hurriedly un-plugged the fireplace.</p><br><p>The boy fetched a torch from the cupboard under the stairs and ran back upstairs.</p><br><p>It was difficult to look inside but the boy was still small enough and craning his neck he managed to look up and shine his light into the inky blackness. The torchlight illuminated the crust of soot and carbon that lined the chute, dark grey, near black, and there, perched on a ledge, its eyes blinking against the sudden brightness, A vivid green, tropical parakeet against the black Victorian chimney soot.</p><br>"
