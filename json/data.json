Now we&rsquo;re without each other again. Hooyo, who cried when I went to Paris because I had never spent more than a night away from her. You haven&rsquo;t told me much about the neighbourhood, the people there, their stories. that playground. Your own loneliness waiting for my father, your husband. The long nights. Leaving your entire family behind and coming somewhere new. The picture doesn&rsquo;t show the bus that came for you each morning, hauling you and the neighbourhood woman to Danish classes. By the end, you were promised perfect Danish and no one inspecting you in the supermarket. Away from everyone and everything you knew. They had lied. No matter how perfect your Danish got, the stares continued. I know now there was so much I could have asked and never did. Where did you want to run when it got bad? Was it back on a plane or was it back to this park you&rsquo;re sitting in? On that bench with your pink baati and gabasaar, abo with the double denim. What did you lose? I&rsquo;m talking to the picture because I&rsquo;m out of your house, and I&rsquo;m using it as a filler until I get back to you. You gave me many things, but to get me ready for marriage and a house, you gave me biscuits, sweets, cake, and dried meat. Instructions for what to do when guests come over. A warning against dirt and mess, against not wearing a bra, against letting myself go. But nothing about what to do when I don&rsquo;t want to get out of bed, or when he gets sick of me being down, again.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"line-height:150%;\"><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:150%;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;'>A mother&rsquo;s manual for survival. What would it say exactly? <em>I&rsquo;m giving you space from me, so call me when you want but I won&rsquo;t be calling you. Imagine throwing a fit with no audience, smashing the plates with nobody coming home to notice, making a mess of your body and nobody being close enough to touch it, rub it to make it warm again? Become a rock. Rocks don&rsquo;t get hurt. You throw it out and it doesn&rsquo;t bruise, you take it away from everything it knows, and it keeps the same face, step on it and it hurts you back. Become hard anything and everything that doesn&rsquo;t want you alive. I don&rsquo;t recognize you like this, body flat against the floor in the centre of a dark room. You were so glad when the mirror smashed. Struggle stops. There are no soldiers in the street yet here you are, a bloody fight in one body. Who hurt you? It&rsquo;s only us here. You&rsquo;re nothing like me. I thought I left you behind.</em>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"line-height:150%;\"><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:150%;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;'>Hooyo, I can&rsquo;t explain the sadness. You wouldn&rsquo;t understand it. But then again, I don&rsquo;t know because you haven&rsquo;t told me. Maybe I haven&rsquo;t asked the right questions. When we get back to each other, can we ask new ones? Ones that recognize I&rsquo;m no longer a child, that walking out of your house doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m dead to you. A flat and a life away from you. It&rsquo;s a different kind of blue. This is how you to taught me to love. Must be listening ear and quiet mouth. Must be opened door holding a cake fresh out of the oven, burning at the ends if need be. Must be quick to help first always, otherwise love will end. Must always remember people come back for me when I&rsquo;m not sad. Must be begging for mercy, surprised if it ever comes. When she&apos;s thinking about us kids dying before her, hooyo repeats &apos;you don&apos;t belong to me, you belong to God&apos; or &apos;you&apos;re not mine&rsquo; and it helps in some way. If she says it enough times to herself, she&rsquo;ll start to believe it. That&rsquo;s the hope. Meaning she&apos;s doing what I&rsquo;m doing, which is going to places alone, eating alone, sitting alone, and getting used to it because there&apos;ll be a time when there&apos;s no one left. There was a time I swore going anywhere alone would have killed me. The first time I walked alone to school I cried all the way. It&rsquo;s funny, I don&apos;t remember the feeling and only have an image of me taking steps and sniffling all the way to the gate. The image as an extension of you. Knowing I don&rsquo;t need the image at all, but I would take it everywhere. That&rsquo;s what she said, the girl I was photographing. She said she kept her parents&rsquo; picture close to her at all times and I should have asked, what does it give you that their physicality doesn&rsquo;t? Can you ask the picture things you can&rsquo;t ask them? Is the photograph more forgiving? This would be the image I&rsquo;d tape to my bedroom door. When I could have gone across the hall and posed the question directly to my parents, I didn&rsquo;t. I sat there and stared at its creases and wrote down the questions and thought, I&rsquo;ll write a poem and the poem will give me answers.</span></p>"

My parents were divorcing, I was about 14 and I came home one day from school, so it was probably about half past 3 or 4 o clock in the afternoon and as soon as I opened the door I could smell red wine. I went to the back of the house to the back room where the smell was coming from and there was a big stain, a red wine stain down one of the curtains in the backroom and there was smashed glass on the floor. Obviously, you know, we washed the curtains, we cleaned them.

I walked over, and I was in a very bright white room at this point and I joined the crowd around you and I bowed my head down, and I realised that we were all bowing our heads in grief. And it was very quiet apart from the sound of birds.

The trees sense each-other and feel each-other. Even grieve one another. Their lined, thick trunks make me think of the feet of elephant, pressed firmly into the ground. Elephants are known to walk hundreds of miles to their pre-determined grave sites. I wonder if an ancient tree knows how to fall? How does a tree grieve? Supposedly there&rsquo;s a shark in Greenland that&rsquo;s over 500-Year-old. I wonder if it&rsquo;s called <em>Sharkspeare</em>?</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;line-height:115%;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;line-height:115%;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>One leviathan has fallen, in an earth-shuddering heap. It feels sad, something so large, what I imagine it might be like to approach a beached whale, to be dwarfed by another body, stuck. But from this sideways tree new growth emerges, perpendicular shoots upwards. Toadstools and wedges of yellow fungus, like slabs of cheese grow in the shade of the trunk. Dead and broken branches are a feast of termites, and as they break down, food for worms. New life emerging from death. As I bend down to look closer at a trail of ants stretched along one of the branches, I think about something I&rsquo;d read about &lsquo;whale-fall&rsquo;, in which, when a whale dies in the ocean, its carcass will initially float on the surface, providing sustenance to hungry scavengers. And as its mass decreases, eventually the body will sink to the bottom, where the leviathan cadaver can become home to entirely new ecosystems. New life emerging from death.</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;line-height:115%;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;line-height:115%;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;line-height:115%;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>After the breakup when I moved back from Canada, I had the strongest desire to see some oak trees. Something affirming. A solid point of reference after upheaval. Five years later I still visit them. Back then I took my old boy Zen, now I take Indigo. I don&rsquo;t think the yearning was from a place of nostalgic homeliness - I grew up in London - in many ways the English countryside still feels alien to me.

Made obsolete by the invention of domestic central heating systems, these fireplaces are sometimes covered up, or filled in. In this particular establishment they had been left, perhaps for decorative purposes. In fact, the design of the interior of the house had that sort of under-stated, minimal beauty, in which the characteristics and furnishings of the building, vestiges of its period past, were respectfully left alone or simply painted off-white in keeping with the rest of the house.</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>The building being old, things were known to on occasion fall off. Over time, brick crumbles. Each day the walls shudder as the local bus passes over the speed bump outside. Whilst it was entirely possible, most likely even, that the noises from the chimney were caused by pieces of falling mortar within the chute, the mother&rsquo;s concern triggered a memory of the story the father had told them years before, about the raven that fell down the chimney. The father had been startled by loud cawing coming from the spare room and was even more surprised to find a confused and distressed raven lying in a soot-covered mess. He had managed to open the window and guide the bird out, the black dust flying as it beat its outstretched wings.</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>The chimney in question, in the mother&rsquo;s room, had been blocked years earlier by the father in order to stop any drafts. If anything, living was in there, then its escape would be blocked by the rudimentary plug, carefully constructed from repurposed cardboard packaging boxes. The boy was fearful to dislodge the construction, He thought of the hands that made it&hellip;the container of old jumpers in the attic, the box of old scribbled on post-it notes that he kept in his room. Treasured footprints.</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>A flash of green and yellow suddenly appeared outside the window. The boy and the mother looked on in amazement at the green parakeet flapping there, suspended for a moment before disappearing again. The mother remarked that not once in 20 years had a green parakeet been seen outside the window.</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>They looked at each other in understanding and concern and hurriedly un-plugged the fireplace.</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>The boy fetched a torch from the cupboard under the stairs and ran back upstairs.</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;border:none;'><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:black;'>It was difficult to look inside but the boy was still small enough and craning his neck he managed to look up and shine his light into the inky blackness. The torchlight illuminated the crust of soot and carbon that lined the chute, dark grey, near black, and there, perched on a ledge, its eyes blinking against the sudden brightness, A vivid green, tropical parakeet against the black Victorian chimney soot.&nbsp;</span></p>"
